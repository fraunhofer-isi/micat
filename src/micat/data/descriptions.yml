reductionOfEnergyPoverty:
  subcategory: Social
  title: Energy poverty
  description: >
    This indicator shows how energy efficiency improvement actions in the residential sector can help 
    lift people out of energy poverty. In order to calculate it, national energy poverty gaps for affected deciles 
    (gap between the energy expenses of the decile and the energy poverty threshold) are compared to the expected 
    energy cost savings, taking lifetimes, subsidy rates, average rent of energy poor households, and many more 
    parameters into account.

energyIntensity:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Impact on energy intensity
  description: >
    Energy intensity describes the amount of energy necessary to generate a unit of gross domestic product (GDP) in 
    a given economy. This graph shows the effect energy efficiency has in reducing it. It is calculated by dividing 
    gross available energy by GDP. The scenario with measures is compared to a scenario populated with past data from 
    Eurostat and projections from PRIMES.

reductionOfImportDependency:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Impact on import dependency
  description: >
    This indicator displays the change in import dependency, the imported share of a resource, for the three main 
    fossil fuels. The change is shown in percent points, comparing the measure to a baseline provided by Eurostat 
    data and PRIMES projections. The underlying assumption is that energy savings would merely reduce energy imports 
    rather than domestic production.
  identifier: reductionOfImportDependency
  yAxis: Reduction in %-points

impactOnGrossDomesticProduct:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Impact on gross domestic product
  description: >
    Energy efficiency measures stimulate added value and increase the gross domestic product (GDP) in economies, 
    which is shown in this indicator. The calculation uses assumptions from the PRIMES model to adjust coefficients 
    stemming from Eurostat's FIGARO input-output tables, which are then multiplied with investment costs. The result 
    represents the cumulative added value generated by the assessed measures by a given year.
  identifier: impactOnGrossDomesticProduct
  yAxis: Added value in M€

additionalEmployment:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Additional employments
  description: >
    Apart from purely behavioural measures, energy efficiency improvements entail additional employments, 
    which are shown in this indicator. The calculation uses assumptions from the PRIMES model to generate coefficients, 
    which are then multiplied with investment costs. The result represents the cumulative additional years of full-time 
    employments generated by the assessed measures by a given year.
  identifier: additionalEmployment
  yAxis: Additional full-time employment years

addedAssetValueOfBuildings:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Added asset value of buildings
  description: >
    A variety of studies has found a positive impact of energy efficiency on the real estate value of buildings. 
    This indicator shows the additional value of commercial, office, and residential buildings. The calculation is 
    based on the capitalisation rates for real estate investments in residential and tertiary buildings, which stem 
    from surveys among actors in the property market.
  identifier: addedAssetValueOfBuildings
  yAxis: Value in M€

changeInUnitCostsOfProduction:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Change in unit costs of production
  description: >
    This indicator describes how the unit costs of production change as a consequence of energy efficiency. 
    As such, it is an indicator for the competitiveness of an industry sector. This indicator is still a work in 
    progress and is lacking some essential data.
  identifier: changeInUnitCostsOfProduction
  yAxis: Value in € / €

turnoverOfEnergyEfficiencyGoods:
  subcategory: Economic
  title: Turnover of energy efficiency goods
  description: >
    Typically, materials essential for energy efficiency in buildings are produced locally. As such, the turnover 
    of energy efficiency goods is an indicator describing the benefit to this specific industry sector. The 
    calculation is based on data from two national case studies.
  identifier: turnoverOfEnergyEfficiencyGoods

energySaving:
  subcategory: Ecologic
  title: Primary savings by fuel
  description: >
    This indicator describes the energy saved in terms of primary energy carriers with the proposed measures. 
    The conversion processes necessary for the generation of hydrogen and synthetic fuels, electricity, and heat are 
    taken into account. The energy mix of these conversion processes comes from past data from Eurostat and 
    projections from PRIMES.

reductionOfAirPollution:
  subcategory: Ecologic
  title: Reduction in air pollution
  description: >
    This graph shows the reductions in air pollutants due to energy efficiency measures. 
    The calculation uses coefficients originating from IIASA's GAINS model, taking into account the specific emissions 
    of energy carriers in different sectors and subsectors.
  identifier: reductionOfAirPollution
  yAxis: Reduction in kt

reductionOfGreenHouseGasEmission:
  subcategory: Ecologic
  title: Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
  description: >
    This indicator assesses the greenhouse gas emission reductions entailed by the examined measures. As one of the 
    central drivers for energy efficiency efforts, this indicator is central in the related discussion, supporting 
    the narrative of energy efficiency improvements helping to tackle climate change. Building on IIASA's GAINS model, 
    this indicator merely takes carbon dioxide emissions into account, not considering other greenhouse gases such as 
    methane or nitrous oxide. As such, the result can be considered a conservative approximation for overall 
    greenhouse gas emissions.

  yAxis: Reduction in ktCO2

renewableEnergyDirectiveTargets:
  subcategory: Ecologic
  title: Impact on RES targets
  description: >
    This indicator examines how energy efficiency can support in achieving the target share of energy originating 
    from renewable energy sources (RES) stated in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). By reducing the overall 
    energy consumption, the share of renewable energy carriers is increased, assuming the energy savings mainly 
    affect non-renewable energy sources.

reductionOfEnergyCost:
  title: Reduction of energy costs
  description: >
    This indicator describes the reduction in energy costs for end users to be expected from energy saving measures. 
    It is calculated from final energy savings, differentiating between energy carriers and sectors, taking lower 
    taxes and rates for commerce and industry into account. In case the energy mix has not been specified in the 
    measure specific parameters, it is calculated from Eurostat and PRIMES data, accounting for the higher 
    prevalence of certain energy carriers in specific improvement actions.

reductionOfLostWorkDays:
  title: Avoided lost working days due to air pollution
  description: >
    Lost working days can be considered a proxy to examine cases of morbidity (although excluding certain groups, 
    such as children, unemployed, etc.). This indicator shows the reduction of lost working days linked to air 
    pollution. Based on IIASA's GAINS model, it takes air pollution data and societal aspects, such as employment and 
    national health levels, into account.
  identifier: reductionOfLostWorkDays

reductionOfGreenHouseGasEmissionMonetization:
  title: Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
  description: >
    This graph displays the monetary benefits associated with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The costs of 
    greenhouse gas emissions can be monetised in several ways, inter alia with the costs of carbon in carbon 
    certificate schemes such as the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), the cost of removal or the cost of avoidance for 
    future generations. The MICATool uses societal costs of carbon as a calculation basis, which are calculated in 
    line with common evaluation methodologies by the German Federal Environmental Agency.
