Impacts of Energy Efficiency (MICATool) by co-creating a free, easy-to-use, scientifically sound online tool. 

As an open source tool, this documentation is supposed to help users understand the workflow, functioning, and 
methodology of the tool and the indicators. Furthermore, it allows for a traceability and transparency with regard to 
the provided figures and results.
