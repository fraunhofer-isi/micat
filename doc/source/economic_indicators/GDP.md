Impact on GDP
=

$\Delta GDP_{c,ss,a,y} = \phi_{c,ss,a,y} \cdot \Delta inv_{c,ss,a,y}$

$\Delta GDP_{c,ss,a,y} = $ impact on gross domestic product (id_indicator_chart = 4), synonym: additional GDP generated by investment for energy saving measure

$\phi_{c,ss,a,y} = $ coefficient for GDP effect, extracted from e3m Excel file (id_parameter = 38)

$\Delta inv_{c,ss,a,y} = $ annual total investment in € from measure specific parameters, source: module [Investments](../modules/investments.md)
