$EMP_{c, ss, a, y} = INV_{c, ss, a, y} \cdot k_{{\rm EMP}, c, a}$

$EMP_{c, ss, a, y}$ = annual additional employment generated by investment for energy saving measures

$INV_{c, ss, a, y}$ = annual investments in M€, stemming from #38 

$k_{{\rm EMP}, c, a}$ = coefficient for employment effects in full-time equivalents per M€ of investment (id_parameter = 39, source: /raw_data/e3m/gdp_employment_extracted.xlsx
