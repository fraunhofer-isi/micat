Economic indicators
===

Impact on GDP
-

Compared to the vast majority of indicators, Impact on GDP requires investments as input. In case it isn't provided, a 
ballpark conversion from energy savings is carried out, although the accuracy severely suffers with this operation.
The coefficients have been provided by e3m and have been calculated from a scenario similar to the EU Reference Scenario
2020 (although not the original one, due to confidentiality issues).

The relevant equations are on [this page](./GDP.md), the fact sheet can be found as a PDF [here](../fact_sheets/impact_on_GDP.pdf).

Employment effects
-

Similar to Impact on GDP, Employment effects scale with investments. Thus, similar caveats as described above apply. The
data source is also identical.

The relevant equations are on [this page](./employment_effects.md), the fact sheet can be found as a PDF [here](../fact_sheets/employment_effects.pdf).
