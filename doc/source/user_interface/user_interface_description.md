The front end vizard
===

Selection of the geographic area
-

In the MICATool vizard, the first step is the selection of the geographic area. Users have the choice between
the whole European Union as of 2020, a Member State, or a municipality/region in a Member State. For the latter
option, the number of inhabitants of the assessed entity is required, in order to allow for the scaling of some
national values. [This page](./geography.md) contains more details about the selection of the geographic area.

Selection of (sub-)sector and improvement action
-

In order for the MICATool to properly work, measures, policies, and scenarios need to be decomposed into combinations 
of (sub-)sectors and improvement actions. This is due to the fact, that impact factors and default values may strongly
differ between different combinations. The selection of (sub-)sectors and improvement action and how to decompose a 
measure is described [on this page](./specifying_subsector_action.md).
