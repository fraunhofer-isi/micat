Accounting of energy savings and how to input them into the MICATool
===

Generally, energy savings can be accounted for in three different ways: new annual savings, total annual savings, and 
cumulative savings. The MICATool uses total annual savings, however, it makes sense to dive a little bit into the topic,
in order to avoid confusion.

New annual savings
-

New annual savings are the savings generated by measures implemented in the examined year.

Total annual savings
-

In contrast to new annual savings, total annual savings take all savings into account that accrue in the examined year
compared to a scenario in which the assessed energy efficiency measures have not been implemented. Thus, all savings 
generated in the examined year by older measures are also considered, as long as the lifetime of the measure is not
over.

Cumulative savings
-

Cumulative savings consider all savings achieved since the inception of the assessed energy efficiency measures until 
the examined year in comparison to a scenario without these savings. Yet, savings are still only accounted within the 
measures' lifetime.
