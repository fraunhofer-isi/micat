Selection of (sub-)sector and improvement action
===


Background
-

The choice of [available sectors and subsectors](../indices/indices_description.md#idsector-and-idsubsector) is linked 
to the differences between default values. For instance, default values within the residential and tertiary sectors 
are rather similar, whereas subsectors within industry vary very strongly in terms of default data. 
In the same sense, [improvement actions](../indices/indices_description.md#idactiontype) have been selected to bundle 
measures with similar default values and parameters.

Decomposition
-

In the course of the decomposition, a measure package, programme, or policy instrument is disaggregated in its
parts, each addressing a certain combination of (sub-)sector and improvement action. Accordingly, shares of the 
total energy savings and investments should be allocated to the single parts. These can then be inputed into the
MICATool. An example is shown in [Figure 1](#decomposition_figure).
